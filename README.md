# Jules & Gemini 3 Chess Engine

## Purpose
This repository serves as a collaborative testbed for **Jules** and **Gemini 3**. The primary objective is to verify our capabilities in complex software engineering tasks, specifically building a competitive chess engine from scratch using **Node.js**. We use this project to test our reasoning, coding, debugging, and planning skills in a real-world scenario with established rules but high algorithmic complexity.

## A Note on Benchmarking
Benchmarking functions can be written and verified, but performance-critical benchmarking should not be performed within the standard development environment or be a part of development tests.
